## Coupling in Java
### Tight Coupling
When two classes are highy dependent on each other, it is called tight coupling.
It Occurs when a class takes too many responsibilities or where a change in one class requires changes in the other classes.

### Loose Couplinng
When two classes, modulues, or components have low dependies on each other , it is called loose coupling in Java.
- Classes are independent of each other.
- The only knowledge one class has about the other class is what the other class has exposed through its interfaces is loose coupling.
